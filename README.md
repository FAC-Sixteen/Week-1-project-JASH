# Week-1-project-JASH
Our Week 1 project! James, Anna, Sam, Henry.

* This is a website we created from scratch as part of the Week 1 project. 
* It is a simple one-page site with three main sections:
    1. **Team**: 
        - "600px+", page divided into a grid of four sections displaying each team member's picture. Hover over each section to reduce opacity of picture and increase opacity of text to reveal respective bios.
        - "-600px", page display switches to flex, image-bio pairs sort into rows(reverse).
    
    3. **About**: 
        - "600px+", page shows a white blockquote with a short blurb, on top of a timelapse of the team working.
        - "-600px", video is not shown, about page is shorter and has a plain white blockquote.
    5. **Contact**:
        - "-600px/600px+", Attempt to make responsive Web form for submitting contact details and accompanying message. placeholder text for all inputs, input types relevant to input and email input features required pattern attribute with regex disallowing invalid inputs.  

    It also includes
    * a header with our slogan so that the client can immediately get a concise description of what we have to offer, and
    * a fixed navigation burger so that the client can easily navigate between the three sections.
    
We mainly pair programmed, alternating pairs to work on different sections. We also ended up using a lot of git to combine the different features we all worked on.

#### What did we learn?
    * Inspect things! Using inspect allowed us to see why some things were in the wrong place (eventually).
    * HSL colour values are awesome.
    * CSS variables.
    
#### What would we improve?
    * Fix mobile form alignment
    * Add click/focus functionality to burger menu
    * Make logo link to top
